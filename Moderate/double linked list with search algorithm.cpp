 * Description:      Demonstrates the creation of a maze comprised of doubly
 *                   linked roomNode's.  A member function assigns a random
 *                   room in the list as an entrance and exit for each 
 *                   iteration of the program.  A search algorithm locates 
 *                   the random maze exit from the random entrance by 
 *                   simulating a path where the explorer keeps their
 *                   left hand on the wall as they progress through the maze.
 *                   This method of maze navigation is appropriate as this
 *                   is not an island maze.  The program completes once the 
 *                   algorithm finds the exit to the maze.
 * Output:           Describes initial and conclusion scenarios.  Outputs
 *                   passage directions to the user.
